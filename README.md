# Steps to run the application:
1) Download the Flickr8k dataset and store the images in the 'Flicker8k_Dataset' folder.
2) Run each cell of the .ipynb file to understand and generate checkpoints. When training the model, a new checkpoint folder will be created and the 5 most recently trained checkpoints are saved.
3) Run the 'app_flask_new.py' file to execute the application.
